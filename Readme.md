## Why This Project Exists

AI agents are easy to build but hard to monetize safely across open networks. Traditional API keys and off-chain billing create trust gaps:
- No atomic link between payment and execution
- No shared payment standard between autonomous clients
- No transparent, verifiable evidence that value moved

Valdyum addresses this by pairing 0x402 style payment negotiation with Stellar transactions and on-chain policy enforcement.

## Why Stellar (and Soroban)

Stellar is a strong fit for machine-to-machine micro-payments and agent marketplaces:
- Fast finality and low fees for frequent small-value API calls
- Mature account model and strong wallet ecosystem (Freighter)
- Great UX for memo-tagged payments, which map naturally to request IDs
- Soroban smart contracts for deterministic validation and inter-contract control
- Publicly verifiable transaction proofs through Horizon / Explorer

## Core Capabilities

- Build custom agents with model, prompt, tools, visibility, and pricing
- Register agents with validator + registry contract flow
- Run agents through a 402 payment challenge-response mechanism
- Fork marketplace agents with paid fork transactions
- Execute paid workflow tasks with invoices and explorer proofs
- Track activity in dashboard and live feed components

## End-To-End Workflow (Start To Finish)

### 1) Wallet Connect And Identity
1. User opens the app and connects Freighter (or other supported wallet).
2. Public key is stored locally for session-scoped UX and request signing context.
### 2) Agent Build + On-Chain Validation
1. User configures agent metadata (name/model/prompt/price/visibility/tools).
2. `POST /api/agents/validate-deploy` builds a Soroban validation transaction (XDR).
3. User signs in wallet.
4. `POST /api/agents/confirm-deploy` submits and prepares confirmation call.
5. Validator contract confirms and performs inter-contract call to registry.
6. Agent metadata is persisted to Supabase for app indexing and search.

### 3) Marketplace Listing + Fork Economy
1. Public agents appear in marketplace cards.
2. Consumer can fork an existing agent by paying fork fee in XLM.
3. Memo ties payment to fork action (`fork:<agent-or-request-id>`).
4. Forked configuration can be customized before first execution.

### 4) 0x402 Request Execution
1. Client calls `POST /api/agents/[id]/run` with prompt input.
2. If unpaid, server returns payment challenge (402 semantics + payment details).
3. Wallet signs and submits Stellar payment.
4. Client retries with tx hash and wallet headers.
5. Server verifies payment via Horizon and executes selected model.
6. Request, billing, and runtime stats are persisted.

### 5) Trading + Workflow Executor
1. Trading page simulates strategy actions with XLM-centric UX.
2. Workflow page batches paid task executions and wallet approvals.
3. Invoice card records amount, tx hash, payer, timestamp, and explorer link.

### 6) Observability And Analytics
1. Realtime events stream through Ably/QStash pipeline.
2. Dashboard aggregates request counts, billing, and latency surfaces.
3. Explorer links provide independent payment proof.

## Smart Contracts

### AgentValidator (`contracts/agent_validator`)
- Validates deploy intent and confirmation signatures
- Manages pending deployment state
- Performs inter-contract call into registry during confirmation

### AgentRegistry (`contracts/agent_registry`)
- Canonical on-chain index for registered agents
- Holds pricing/ownership metadata and request accounting hooks
- Serves as the source of truth for validator cross-contract checks

### Inter-Contract Call Flow

```text
Client -> validate-deploy API -> sign tx -> confirm-deploy API
-> AgentValidator.confirm_deploy(...)
-> invoke_contract(AgentRegistry.register_agent(...))
-> on-chain registration success
```

## Validation Screens (Important One-Liners)

1. Freighter fork confirmation proves user-signed payment authorization before marketplace fork completes.
2. Stellar Expert receipt confirms fork tx finality, ledger inclusion, memo integrity, and signature validity.
3. Marketplace success banner shows app-level acknowledgment wired to confirmed chain payment.
4. Run-agent payment modal demonstrates 402 challenge-response UX tied to wallet signature.
5. Agent run summary shows billed amount and runtime metadata linked to the paid execution path.
6. Build step validation modal proves deploy flow requires explicit wallet approval before contract submission.
7. Confirm-deploy warning state highlights guarded confirmation path for potentially failing preconditions.
8. Trading surface demonstrates XLM-focused strategy execution context integrated with wallet identity.
9. Workflow executor waiting state proves asynchronous task orchestration blocked on wallet payment signature.
10. Workflow invoice panel provides structured proof payload: tx hash, payer, amount, timestamp, explorer link.
11. Dashboard panels aggregate monetization telemetry and request analytics after protocol interactions.

## API Surface

- `POST /api/agents/create`
- `GET /api/agents/list`
- `GET /api/agents/[id]`
- `POST /api/agents/[id]/run`
- `POST /api/agents/validate-deploy`
- `POST /api/agents/confirm-deploy`
- `POST /api/agents/submit-confirmation`
- `POST /api/payment/verify`
- `GET /api/dashboard/analytics`
- `GET /api/dashboard/requests`
- `GET /api/ably/token`

## Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- pnpm 10+
- Freighter wallet (for end-to-end payment/deploy tests)
- Supabase project (recommended for full mode)

### Install

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Configure Environment

Create local env and fill your own keys (never commit secrets):

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

### Run

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### Build

```bash
pnpm run lint
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm run build
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

Workflow file: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

1. `lint-and-type-check`: ESLint CLI + TypeScript noEmit
2. `build`: Next production build + artifact upload
3. `docker-build`: Docker buildx image build (no push)

This pipeline ensures code quality, type safety, production build integrity, and deploy parity.

## Security Notes

- `.env.local` and `.env.local.bak` are ignored and must remain local only.
- Never commit API keys, private keys, or service-role secrets.
- If a key is ever exposed, rotate it immediately.

## Project Vision

Valdyum demonstrates that autonomous software can be monetized transparently when identity, payment, and execution are composed as one protocol surface.

By building on Stellar, the project converts abstract AI usage into verifiable economic events that users, builders, and integrators can trust.
